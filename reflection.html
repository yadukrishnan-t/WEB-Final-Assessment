        A Responsive Web Design simply results in a dynamic design that adapts
        to the environment it is run and it depends on the platform, screen size etc. of the environment. Basically, one solution could be used to run on multiple platforms making the code very mobile and flexible. By adaptation, it means it would change the appearance according to the screen width and resolution. The resulting solution would be readable on all devices with proper spacing and alignment. The responsive design came into place when devices with countless types of resolutions and sizes started releasing and practically everyone has an electronic device with them. Making a design based on one device specification became literally impossible and it had to be adaptive. The website in a way responds and adapts to the user's preferences and device specifications. This includes the myriad number of screen sizes and also the landscape and portrait mode.

        Geneally in a responsive design, the principle is mobile-first i.e. the code is built for the mobile platforms first and then scaled up to work with bigger environments. 
        The main principles of Responsive Web Design are Fluid Grid system, Fluid image use, and Media queries. Fluid grid system refers to the relative sizes for webpages and fluid images also refers to the same which would have relative sizes in percentage rather than a fixed height and width. Media Queries just means the altering of the layout on specific conditions i.e. at a specific breakpoint, the design could be set to alter based on the platform. For extreme changes, the layout would be changed altogether though, with the media queries itself or a separate stylesheet. However, the basic styling would be inherited and remain the same and the specific ones will only need some basic adjustments in height, width, etc.

        First thing I learned about building responsive designs is that it's generally best to go mobile-first and then scale up from there. I should build an idea of the general client requirements in terms of the sizes of the screen i.e. width, resolution, etc that the solution is built for. Consequently, based on these requirements the solution be designed and built and ideally this solution must work on all platforms. Using frameworks would be a great way to build websites quicker while still making them responsive. The sizes must be relative instead of being fixed and if fixed they must be adapted in each media query. Responsive design needs a more abstract way of thinking and it's not just about adjustable screen sizes and images.

        I learned the basics of Web development through this course. I have got familiarized with the foundation, mainly being the HTML5, CSS3 and
        JavaScript. The HTML builds the skeleton, CSS adds the skin and outer
        layers, and finally javascript makes everything tick to get the blood flowing and together this
        gives a functional enitity and in this case a website. Starting with the very basic Javascript in the initial weeks, I have slowly learned the basics in this course and finally have done the html validation integrating all of them together.
